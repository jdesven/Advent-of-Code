    "1. If the report has ascending levels but it contains a level where the level is higher or equal than the level that follows it, then the report is unsafe.\n",
    "1. If the report has descending levels but it contains a level where the level is lower or equal than the level that follows it, then the report is unsafe.\n",
    "3. If the report contains a level where the level differs more than three from the next level, then the report is unsafe.\n",

    "If none of these conditions apply for any of the levels in the report, then the report is safe.\n",

Instead of evaluating the full report itself, we consider all possible reports that would follow from the original report if we remove one level from the report.
