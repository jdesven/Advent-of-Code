    "For every claw machine, the A button moves the claw by $(a_X,a_Y)$, while the B button moves the claw by $(b_X,b_Y)$. The prize is located at $(p_X,p_Y)$. The parameters $a_X$, $a_Y$, $b_X$, $b_Y$, $p_X$, and $p_Y$ are known parameters from the input file. If we represent the number of times we press the A button and B button as $T_A$ and $T_B$, respectively, the problem becomes [a system of linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations) with two unknowns.\n",

    "The solution to either linear equation can be rewritten as $T_A=-bT_B/a+p/a$, which forms a linear line in $(X,Y)$ space. The solution(s) to the full system of equations thus equal the point(s) where these lines intersect. Since both lines are linear, [there can only be 0, 1, or infinitely many intersection points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection). However, since all constants and unknowns in the system are in $\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ (positive, non-zero integers), $T_A$ cannot surpass $p_X/a_X$, or the claw will overshoot $p_X$. Since there is a finite amount of integers between 1 and $p_X/a_X$, an infinite amount of solutions can never occur. This ensures that any claw machine with a solution, has one and only one solution. As a result, we will not have to test which solution has the lowest token cost (even though the puzzle text implies otherwise).\n",

If $A_i$ is the matrix formed by replacing the $i$-th column of $A$ by the column vector $\\bf{p}$, then [Cramer's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule) states that the solutions to the system of linear equations can be calculated from the [determinants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant) of the matrices $A$ and $A_i$.\n",

If this condition holds true, we have the one and only solution to the system of linear equations.\n",
